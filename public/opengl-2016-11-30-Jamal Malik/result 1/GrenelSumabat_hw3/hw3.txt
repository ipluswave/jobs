I created a scene that contains mountains, trees, and houses. My mountains, trees, and houses contains triangles which was 
initialized by buildMountain(), buildTree(), and buildHouse(). Fixed numbers of all 3 should be created. In order to draw the mountains 
in a distance, the fTransX and fTransY is in range 1.6~2.0, then the trees fTransY is in range 1.6~2.0 with it's fTransX range -1 ~ 1 
because they shouldn't collide with the mountains. For the houses, fTransX and FtransY are in range -2 ~ 1.2 so they they appear near. All 
objects' size of mountains, trees, and house are random. nRotateZ is for the objects direction. 

Init vertex arrays for drawing objects. First created buffers for object and bind it to vertexarrays and then you can set any number for 
however many number of that object you want to draw. For example, #define TreeCount is at 3 for only 3 trees but if I change that to 30 
I will get 30 trees.

The main drawing function is display. The first 4 lines is for the cameras view.
Drawing object function is traverse. The difference in my traverse is the render function. 
I added index parameter for drawing the i-th object. Every drawing functins only calls 
drawObjectColored function wit their type, vertexarrayobject, and vertices count as parameters.
And drawObjectColored function select program for that type and bind vertexarrray and draw triangles.
